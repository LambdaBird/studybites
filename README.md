## ‚öôÔ∏è Local setup

**Development is currently in a very early stage. The solution isn't ready to be used in a production environment.**

```
git clone https://github.com/LambdaBird/studybites.git

SB_ADMIN_EMAIL="ADMIN_EMAIL" SB_ADMIN_PASSWORD="ADMIN_PASSWORD" docker compose up --build

<!-- add test users -->
yarn --cwd ./api seed:run
```

Go to http://localhost:3018 and enter your SB_ADMIN_EMAIL and SB_ADMIN_PASSWORD you've set upper.

### Demo mode

The main differences between the demo mode and the core one:

- registration as a teacher by default
- the student's office is disabled
- courses are disabled
- an anonymous user can take any lesson

To run in demo mode:

```
DEMO_MODE=true SB_ADMIN_EMAIL="ADMIN_EMAIL" SB_ADMIN_PASSWORD="ADMIN_PASSWORD" docker compose up --build
```

## Testing

Core app

```

```

Demo app
